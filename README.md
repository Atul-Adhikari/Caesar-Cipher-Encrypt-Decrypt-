Caesar Cipher


The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar who used it in his military communications. It works by shifting the letters of a message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. This project implements the Caesar Cipher, allowing users to both encrypt and decrypt messages.


Features:
  1. Encryption: Transforms a given message by shifting the letters based on the provided shift value.
  2. Decryption: Reverts an encrypted message back to its original form by reversing the shift.
  3. Case-sensitive: Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  4. Non-alphabet characters: Symbols, spaces, and numbers remain unaffected, ensuring readability of complex messages.
  5. Flexible shift: Users can provide custom shift values to alter the encryption.

  
This Caesar Cipher project is perfect for those interested in basic cryptography and programming techniques related to string manipulation. Itâ€™s a simple but effective demonstration of how encryption algorithms work in principle, providing a strong foundation for learning more advanced cryptography concepts.
